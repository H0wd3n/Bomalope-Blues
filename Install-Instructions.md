# Install Instructions
## The first step is of course make sure you have rimworld installed through Steam and make sure any mods you already have are disabled.
- After that right click the game on steam, go to properties -> local files and verify integrety of game files to make sure rimworld is installed correctly.

## Downloading the Rimworld mod manager called Rimpy. 
- This step is non-negotiable as it is how I mod Rimworld and it provides a way to edit your modlist externally without loading the game every time you make a change and with a nice interface, allows you to convert textures from mods to the .dds format which the game has a better time loading, save modlists incase you want to back them up and have multiple lists, and the most important part is sorting the mod load order efficiently with one button.

## Installing Rimpy
- You can download it [here](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases/tag/1.2.6.28). Make sure you grab the windows version.

### Once you have it downloaded make a folder in a place of your choosing and extract the contents using 7zip or whatever other program you use for zip files. You can delete the original zip after extracting if you wish.

## Subscribing to Rimpy on Steam
- Go to this [link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1847679158&searchtext=rimpy) and click subscribe like any other workshop mod on Steam.
This step downloads the database files from Steam Rimpy needs to sort and manage the mods correctly.
- After the Rimpy database files are done downloading through Steam launch Rimworld. Once you are at the main menu, close the game.
### DO NOT ENABLE THIS MOD IN RIMWORLD. KEEP IT DISABLED!

## Using Rimpy
- Now from the folder you extracted Rimpy find the exe named Rimpy.exe and launch it. (I recommend creating a shortcut wherever you prefer to launch it quickly)

### Once it is open, it will look like this. Do not worry about any warnings or errors. (Depending if you have any mods already or not it may differ slightly from my install)

### First, at the top make sure Rimpy knows where your game is installed. The autodetect button should work. If not you can set it manually by clicking the three dots to the right.

## Installing Performance Fish - DO NOT GO TO THIS DISCORD TO REPORT ANY ISSUES WITH THIS LIST OR MODS! YOU ARE ONLY JOINING TO DOWNLOAD THIS MOD!
### Next step is to grab a wonderful mod named Performance fish which you can get from joining this [discord](https://discord.gg/699XPDwt8U) and going to this post [here](https://discord.com/channels/241677926855081984/917207536745218068/1035304227368599652) after joining the server.

- Once you have that downloaded, head back over to Rimpy and click the local mods button at the top left and then extract the Performance Fish.zip mod there
- After that, there should be a little refresh icon in Rimpy blinking. If you click that it will refresh Rimpy and the mod Performance Fish should show up in the left column as a local mod. ![Performance Mod](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75699296/226827429-390bd17a-f5f1-4a8d-970c-02dafc37ccf7.png) Don't do anything with it.

## Downloading the rest of the mods
### Go to [this Steam workshop collection](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2950431243) and click subscribe to all. This will download the rest of the mods through steam. Once that is finished, you can head to the next step.

## Installing the list 
- Now, after all the mods are downloaded through steam refresh Rimpy again and then go to the [releases tab](https://github.com/H0wd3n/Boomalope-Blues/releases/tag/Boom) and download the Boomalope.BLues.zip file and extract the zip to your desktop.
- Once you have done that, head back over to Rimpy once again and find the button named import list. Click it and on the windows explorer popup go to your desktop and make sure you have the Boomalope Blues.xml file selected and then click open.![boom xml](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75699296/226829248-b5c53f66-00db-4e1f-98b0-9bf58a9fafa7.png)
- After you do that Rimpy should have imported the modlist to the right column.
### Now click save to save the modlist to your game. You're not done yet though!
## Converting Textures to .dds
### Now this part can take some time depending on your hardware.
- On the right side of Rimpy, there should be a button named optimze tex. When you click it, a new window should pop up like this
![optimze tex](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/75699296/226830384-3e4e1676-385f-4fa6-af4d-a4bded84d513.png)
### At the top make sure you read the Warning in red.
- Next click select active (or select all if you wish to convert every mod you have isntalled that isn't part of this list) and then select the tab that says "BC7 Texeconv Compressor (GPU, high quality)". Once that is selected, click convert textures. As I mentioned before this process can take time, so be patient and let it finish.
- Once it has finished you will see a box that says "Textures were successfully converted". Click OK and close out that window.
- Click the blinking refresh symbol once again and then click save.

## Installing the mod's config files
- Last step! Head back over to the [release tab](https://github.com/H0wd3n/Boomalope-Blues/releases/tag/Boom) again and download Configs.zip
### WARNING!! IF YOU HAVE ANY OF THESE MODS DOWNLOADED ALREADY AND HAVE EDITED THE MODS SETTINGS IN-GAME THIS WILL OVERRIDE THOSE SETTINGS. SKIP THE MODS YOU ALREADY HAVE OR BACK UP THE XML FILES!
- Now, in Rimpy at the top left find the button named Config Folder and drag all the .xml files in the zip you just downloaded there. After that click save once again in Rimpy.
##  Congrats! You have installed the modlist and everything is finished. I hope you enjoy the it!
 - Don't worry about any errors on startup that you get it's normal for that to happen. When you are getting constant errors in-game and it is tanking your performance something is wrong
