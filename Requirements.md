# Requirements
 - First off you need to own Rimworld on Steam and preferably all the dlc's (Royalty, Ideology, and Biotech). If you don't own all of them I will provide instructions on what mods need to be disabled later.
 - Rimworld also needs to be updated to the latest 1.4.3704 version (as long as you are not opted into a beta you will be fine).
 - If you can run Rimworld fine vanilla or with mods you already have without any issues, then you should be ok hardware wise.
 - The modlist doesn't require much space so as long as you have at least 5gigs available, you should™ be fine.
