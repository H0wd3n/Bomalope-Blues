# Requirements
 - First off you need to own Rimworld on Steam and preferably all the dlc's (Royalty, Ideology, and Biotech).
 - If you can run Rimworld fine vanilla or with mods you already have without any issues, then you should be ok hardware wise.
 - The modlist doesn't require much space so as long as you have at least 5gigs available, you shouldâ„¢ be fine.
