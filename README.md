# Read me! Or Else...
- This is a modlist for Rimworld focused on performance and quality of life mods, No major content mods are added (sorry Combat Extended enjoyers) other than a few Vanilla Expanded mods that I feel compliment the Vanilla game well. Feel free to add/remove mods you like or dislike to the list but know that no support will be given if you do so. As for the specific settings for each mod, I will provide the configs I use, but feel free to tweak them yourself. They shouldn't™ cause any issues. I have tweaked them to my liking and for the best performance.
- This list will be updated/edited when I have the time or when Rimworld gets a major update (if I remember)
- A mod that some of you may dislike is Called [Clean Textures](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2865361569&searchtext=clean). Feel free to disable this mod at any time if you dislike the new textures for the dirt etc. It is just textures so it is save safe and can be removed at any time.
- Another mod this list includes is [Cherry Picker](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2633276599). I highly recomend going to the Steam workshop page and reading what this mod does as it lets you customize the list even further if you wish to do so.
## Do not go to any mod page this list includes asking for support for this list. Only go to the mod pages for support if a certain mod itself is causing errors/problems. They will (most likely) not help you with this list!
