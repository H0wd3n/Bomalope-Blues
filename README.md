# Read me!
- This is a modlist focused on performance and quality of life mods, No major content mods are added (sorry Combat Extended enjoyers) other than a few Vanilla Expanded mods that I feel compliment the Vanilla game well. Feel free to add/remove mods you like or dislike to the list but know that no support will be given if you do so. As the specific settings for each mod, I will provide the configs I use but feel free to tweak them yourself they shouldn'tâ„¢ cause any issues. I have tweaked them to my liking and for the best performance.

# Install Instructions
## The first step is of course make sure you have rimworld installed through Steam mods you already have (if any) are disabled.
After that right click the game on steam, go to properties -> local files and verify integrety of game files to make sure rimworld is installed correctly.

## Downloading the Rimworld mod manager called Rimpy. 
- This step is non-negotiable as it is how I mod Rimworld and it provides a way to edit your modlist externally without loading the game every time you make a change and with a nice interface, allows you to convert textures from mods to the .dds format which the game has a better time loading, save modlists incase you want to back them up and have multiple lists, and the most important part is sorting the mod load order efficiently with one button.

## Installing Rimpy
- You can download it [here](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/releases/download/1.2.6.28/RimPy_Windows.zip). Make sure you grab the windows version.

- Once you have it downloaded make a folder in a place of your choosing and extract the contents using 7zip or whatever other program you use for zip files. You can delete the original zip after extracting if you wish.

## Subscribing to Rimpy on Steam
- Go to this [link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1847679158&searchtext=rimpy) and click subscribe like any other workshop mod on Steam.
This step downloads the database files from steam Rimpy needs to sort and manage the mods correctly.
- After the Rimpy database files are done downloading through Steam launch Rimworld. Once you are at the main menu close the game.
### DO NOT ENABLE THIS MOD IN RIMWORLD. KEEP IT DISABLED!

## Using Rimpy
- Now from the folder you extracted Rimpy find the exe named Rimpy.exe and launch it.(I recommend creating a shortcut wherever you prefer to launch it quickly)

### Once it is open it will look like this (Depending if you have any mods already or not it may differ slightly from my install)

### First at the top make sure Rimpy knows where your game is installed. The autodetect button should work If not you can set it manually by clicking the three dots to the right
